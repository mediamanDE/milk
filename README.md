Milk
====
Milk is essential for most coffee geeks.
In the same way we aim to produce a fast & sleek group communication tool with this project.
It heavily borrows ideas from Twitter and the likes, and though it's meant to be useful,
the main purpose is to be a [Breakable Toy](http://apprenticeship-patterns.labs.oreilly.com/ch05.html#breakable_toys)
for our team at [mediaman technology](http://mediaman-technology.de).
